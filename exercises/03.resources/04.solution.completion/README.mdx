# Resource Template Completions

üë®‚Äçüíº Great! That's a much better experience for our users who will be trying to
select the appropriate resource for their task.

Eventually, this API will hopefully support something like a `title` and `description` for each resource. This would allow us to provide a more informative experience for our users.

Follow the status of [this SEP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1440) to see when this will be available.
