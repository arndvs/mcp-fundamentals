# Resource Templates

👨‍💼 Fantastic work! You've just leveled up your MCP server by implementing
dynamic resource templates. Now your server can expose entire collections of
resources—like entries and tags—making them discoverable and accessible to
clients and LLMs alike.

This is a huge step toward building rich, interactive, and context-aware
applications. By leveraging resource templates, you've made it possible for
clients to browse, search, and retrieve structured data on demand.

Key takeaways from this step:

- How to define parameterized resource templates
- How to make individual resources accessible by unique URIs

You're well on your way to building a truly powerful and flexible MCP server.
Keep going—there's even more you can do with resources!
