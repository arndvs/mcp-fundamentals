# Embedded Resources

👨‍💼 Great! Now the LLM can still get the full details of a journal entry and the
client can use the information from the resource to subscribe to the URI or
request it again in the future.

Key takeaways from this step:

- How to embed resource references in tool responses using `type: 'resource'`
- How to provide the correct URI and metadata for each resource
- How to deliver the reference so clients can follow it if they need to
- How to include the resource data itself in the response

With this, your MCP server is ready to power an even more context-aware,
intelligent applications. Great job!
