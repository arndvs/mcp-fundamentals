# Linked Resources

👨‍💼 Brilliant work! You've just unlocked a new level of interactivity by
linking to resources directly in your tool responses. Now your tools and
resources can work hand-in-hand, giving clients and LLMs richer, more actionable
results.

By including resource references (and even the resource data itself) in your
tool outputs, you've made it possible for users to seamlessly follow links,
fetch more details, and build powerful workflows that combine actions and
context.

Key takeaways from this step:

- How to link to resource references in tool responses using `type: 'resource_link'`
- How to provide the correct URI and metadata for each resource
- How to deliver the reference so clients can follow it if they need to

With this, your MCP server is ready to power truly context-aware, intelligent
applications. Great job!
