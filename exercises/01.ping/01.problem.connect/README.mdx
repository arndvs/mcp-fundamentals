# Ping

👨‍💼 Let's get our MCP server running. The TypeScript SDK for MCP supports `ping`
out of the box, so all we need to do is initialize the server, set up a
transport for it, and then it should respond to `ping` requests.

<callout-info>
	ℹ️ NOTE: When initializing your MCP server, you'll need to provide `name` and
	`version` fields. The `name` is a human-readable identifier for your server
	(for example, `MyProductName`), and the `version` indicates the version of
	your server (such as `1.0.0`). These fields help clients and tools identify
	and interact with your server correctly, and are required by the MCP
	specification.
</callout-info>

Start in <InlineFile file="src/index.ts" /> and follow the instructions in the
comments.

Right now if you try to run the server, you'll get an error. Let's fix that!
