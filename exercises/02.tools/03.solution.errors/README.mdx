👨‍💼 Nicely done! Now, when something goes wrong, LLMs get a clear, structured
error message which they can use to generate a proper message for the end user.
This makes the app much more robust and user-friendly, and helps everyone know
exactly what went wrong and why.

With proper error handling in place, your tools are ready for real-world use—no
more silent failures or confusing responses!

🧝‍♀️ We're going to make things a little bit more realistic than a Calculator MCP.
I'm going to update everything to be a full journaling application that is 100%
accessible through MCP, complete with database and everything. You can take
a <NextDiffLink>look at the diff here</NextDiffLink> if you're curious to check
out my changes. I will also be restructuring our MCP server to be structured in
a similar manner as Cloudflare MCP servers are structured. We'll be moving over
to a `class`. That change will be in the diff as well.
