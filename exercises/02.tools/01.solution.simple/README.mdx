👨‍💼 Great job! You've just enabled tool support in your MCP server and registered
your very first tool. This is a foundational step—now your server can expose
functionality to clients in a standardized, discoverable way.

With this in place, you're ready to build more dynamic and interactive tools.
Next, you'll learn how to accept input and return results based on user-provided
arguments.

Key learnings from this step:

- How to declare the `tools` capability on your MCP server
- How to register a simple tool and return a structured response
- The basics of the MCP tool invocation flow

Onward to dynamic tools!
