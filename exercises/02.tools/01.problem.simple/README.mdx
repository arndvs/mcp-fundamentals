# Simple Tool

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicai.pro/workshops/day-1-setup-intro-and-tools/simple-tool~f8kip" />

👨‍💼 Let's get your MCP server ready to support tools! In this step, you'll:

- Declare the `tools` capability on your server.
- Register a simple tool named `add` that always returns the sum of 1 and 2
  (hardcoded).

This is your first step toward making your server interactive and extensible. No
need to handle dynamic input yet—just get the tool registered and returning a
static result.

As a reminder, here's an example of a tool:

```ts
server.registerTool(
	'hello',
	{
		title: 'Hello',
		description: 'Say hello',
	},
	async () => {
		return {
			content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello, world!' }],
		}
	},
)
```
